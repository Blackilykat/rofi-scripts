# Rofi scripts
This repository contains all my basic rofi scripts I made.

Do expect a lot of very basic features as I had the great idea to *not* have a bar on my window manager, and some of these will replace some basic feature any bar has (like a [clock](clock/))

Feel free to take anything and do anything with it and whatever, I don't really know how the legal stuff works but I don't care enough to figure it out and put a license and whatever. Would be nice to be credited if you share it tho
